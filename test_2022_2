 #This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:
 # B , Y = paper 
    # A , X = rock
    # C , Z = scissors
    # for me = Y , X , Z    Y = + 2 , X = + 1 , Z = + 3 win = + 6 lose = + 0 equal = + 3
#  A, B, C, X, Y
 #   In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).
  #  In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).
   # The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.

# In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).


# the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, 
# Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win. Good luck!"
